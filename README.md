# TfL Data Visualiser App

This project is an offshoot of the [sounds-good](https://github.com/pablisch/sounds-good) (name correct at time of writing) repository for the London Underground Phony Orchestra App made as a final project of the Makers Software Dev Bootcamp.

## Running this app

To run this app in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```

To run this app in production mode:
Requires [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to be installed globally
```bash
npm install -g serve
```
Then run:
```bash
npm run build
serve -s build
```


## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a data visualisation of TfL data to support the [sounds-good](https://github.com/pablisch/sounds-good) London Underground Phony Orchestra App.
It was designed to be separate from the main app to allow for a more flexible development process but also to allow for the possibility of the visualisation being used in other projects.
The group made the decision to bring this app into the main app repository to allow for easier progression and to allow for the visualisation to be used in the main app including the final production build.



<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run test:unit`

Runs only the cypress component tests (excluding the e2e tests)

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
